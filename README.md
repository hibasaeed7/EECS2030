# EECS2030 - Advanced Object-Oriented Programming

This repository contains my work for **EECS2030: Advanced Object-Oriented Programming** at York University (Winter 2020). The course focuses on implementing APIs, developing object-oriented software, and analyzing program structure and complexity using Java.

## ðŸ“š Course Description

EECS2030 builds on the object-oriented principles introduced in earlier courses (EECS1020, EECS1021, EECS1022, or EECS1720), with a focus on implementation rather than usage. While earlier courses emphasize building applications using APIs, this course teaches how to **design and implement** those APIs.

### ðŸ”§ Core Topics Covered
- **Implementing Classes**  
  Utilities & non-utilities, delegation, documentation, and API generation
- **Aggregations and Compositions**  
  Designing collections and working with complex data types
- **Inheritance Hierarchies**  
  Visibility, method overriding, abstract classes, interfaces, inner classes
- **Generics**
- **Recursion and Linked Lists**
- **Complexity Analysis**  
  Informal analysis of time complexity and algorithm correctness

Throughout the course, tools such as **Eclipse (IDE)** and **JUnit (testing framework)** were used extensively for development and testing.
